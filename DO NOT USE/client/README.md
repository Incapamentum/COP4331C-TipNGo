The contents of this folder were created upon initialization
of the default heroku application. I didn't like them and 
wanted to start from scratch, so I stashed them away. The
files are being kept for reference purposes but should be
deleted before final build.

The root project folder hierarchy follows a 
CodingTheSmartWay.com MERN stack tutorial project.
